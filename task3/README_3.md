**Task-3**

## 🗂️ Project Summary

🔁 **7-Segment Counter Using I2C (0–49 Loop)**  
Displays numbers from 0 to 49 using a 7-segment display controlled via the Adafruit I2C Backpack.  
Demonstrates I2C communication with Adafruit_7segment and GFX libraries.  
Simplifies display management with built-in hardware decoding.

🦾 **Servo Sweep (0°–x°–0°)**  
Sweeps a positional micro servo from 0° to x° and back continuously.  
Utilizes the Servo library and pulse width range customization.  
Showcases PWM control and precise angle-based motion.

🔄 **Stepper Motor Directional Rotation**  
Rotates a stepper motor back and forth based on configurable parameters.  
User-adjustable direction, speed (RPM), and number of rotations.  
Demonstrates control using the Stepper library and multi-pin driving.
