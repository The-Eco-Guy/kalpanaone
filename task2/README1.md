### Embedded Systems & Automation – Task Phase

## Task-2

### 🗂️ Project Summary

---

#### 🔘 LED Brightness Control Using millis (3 Levels)

- Gradually adjusts LED brightness through 3 states: **High → Medium → Low**
- Triggered using millis()
- Implements `analogWrite()` for PWM-based brightness variation

---

#### 🔢 4-Bit Binary Up Counter with LEDs

- Displays binary values from **0 to 15** using 4 LEDs  
- Showcases binary counting using digital output
- Illustrates the concept of bitwise manipulation

---

#### 🧮 7-Segment Counter Display (00 to 49 and loops back)

- Sequentially counts from **00 to 49** and back down to **00**
- Utilizes **dual 7-segment displays**
- Demonstrates digit encoding logic for segment control
